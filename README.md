# Julia Codespace Template
Template for easy launch of julia in codespace

## How to start
- Click the green "Code" button.
- Select the "Codespace" tab.
- Click the "Create codespace on main" button.
- The codespace (online vscode editor) is launched. Now you can use julia.

## How it works
- You can write a setup script for julia at [.devcontainer.json](.devcontainer.json)
- The codespace uses the script to instantiate the VM.
- You can obtain the above script by following [the instruction](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces). As of 2022, it is just a single simple json file.
